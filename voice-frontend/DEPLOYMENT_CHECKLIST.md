# ðŸš€ United Voice Agent - Production Deployment Checklist

## Current Status âœ…
- **Frontend**: Ready for Vercel deployment
- **Backend**: Ready for Railway deployment
- **UI**: Working perfectly (no changes made)
- **Build**: All errors fixed, builds successfully

## Step 1: Deploy Backend to Railway (5 minutes)

```bash
# From project root directory
cd /Users/ryanyin/united-voice-agent

# Install Railway CLI if not installed
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Deploy backend
./deploy-to-railway.sh
```

After deployment, Railway will give you a URL like:
`https://united-voice-backend-production.up.railway.app`

## Step 2: Configure Vercel Environment (2 minutes)

Update `/Users/ryanyin/united-voice-agent/voice-frontend/.env.production`:

```bash
# Replace with your Railway backend URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=https://united-voice-backend-production.up.railway.app
```

## Step 3: Deploy Frontend to Vercel (5 minutes)

```bash
# From frontend directory
cd /Users/ryanyin/united-voice-agent/voice-frontend

# Pre-deployment check
./pre-deploy-check.sh

# Deploy to Vercel
./deploy-vercel.sh --production
```

Vercel will give you a URL like:
`https://united-voice-agent.vercel.app`

## Step 4: Update Backend CORS (2 minutes)

In Railway dashboard, add environment variable:
```
CORS_ORIGINS=https://united-voice-agent.vercel.app
```
