- **Contextual Adaptation**: Dynamic personality adjustment based on user sentiment and conversation stage
- **Natural Language Patterns**: Uses authentic conversational transitions like "Alright," "Great!" and "Perfect!" rather than robotic responses
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Recognizes and appropriately responds to user frustration, excitement, or confusion

#### **Advanced Context & Memory Systems**
```
Multi-Layer Memory Architecture:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Session Context (Current conversation) │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Working Memory (Recent exchanges)      │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Booking Context (Trip details)        │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Meta-Memory (User patterns)           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
- **Comprehensive Context Tracking**: Maintains conversation history, user preferences, and booking progression
- **Personalization**: References previous conversation elements and customer information naturally
- **Continuity**: Seamlessly handles interruptions and conversation resumption

#### **Voice-Optimized Output**
- **TTS-Friendly Formatting**: Removes markdown, adds natural pauses, and optimizes rhythm for speech synthesis
- **Conversation Flow**: Structures responses for natural spoken delivery with appropriate pacing
- **ElevenLabs Integration**: High-quality text-to-speech with emotion and personality consistency

#### **Intelligent Error Recovery**
