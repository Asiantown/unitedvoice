# Branching Flows and User Prompts

## Overview
The United Voice Agent employs an advanced state machine architecture coupled with ML-powered intent recognition to orchestrate complex, branching conversation flows. This sophisticated system enables natural, non-linear conversations that dynamically adapt to user needs, handle corrections seamlessly, and support multiple conversation patterns while maintaining context and conversational coherence.

## State Machine Architecture

### Core States
```python
class BookingState(Enum):
    IDLE = "idle"
    GREETING = "greeting"
    COLLECTING_NAME = "collecting_name"
    COLLECTING_DEPARTURE = "collecting_departure"
    COLLECTING_DESTINATION = "collecting_destination"
    COLLECTING_TRIP_TYPE = "collecting_trip_type"
    COLLECTING_DATE = "collecting_date"
    COLLECTING_RETURN_DATE = "collecting_return_date"
    PRESENTING_OPTIONS = "presenting_options"
    CONFIRMING_SELECTION = "confirming_selection"
    BOOKING_COMPLETE = "booking_complete"
    ERROR = "error"
```

### State Transition Architecture

#### Primary State Flow
```
     IDLE
       ↓
    GREETING
       ↓
COLLECTING_NAME ←→ [Corrections & Clarifications]
       ↓
COLLECTING_DEPARTURE ←→ [Corrections & Clarifications]
       ↓
COLLECTING_DESTINATION ←→ [Corrections & Clarifications]
       ↓
COLLECTING_TRIP_TYPE
    ↙        ↘
One-Way    Round-Trip
   ↓           ↓
COLLECTING_DATE  COLLECTING_DATE
   ↓           ↓
   ↓      COLLECTING_RETURN_DATE
   ↓           ↓
   ↘         ↙
 FLEXIBLE_SEARCH ←→ [User wants flexible options]
       ↓
PRESENTING_OPTIONS
       ↓
CONFIRMING_SELECTION ←→ [Changes & Corrections]
       ↓
BOOKING_COMPLETE
```

        else:
            return self._plan_linear_progression(intent_result, current_state)
```

### Dynamic Flow Adaptation
```python
def process_input_with_intent(self, user_input: str) -> str:
    """Process input based on recognized intent"""
    
    intent_result = self.intent_recognizer.recognize_intent(
        user_input, 
        self.state.value, 
        self.booking_info
    )
    
    # Route to appropriate handler based on intent
    if intent_result.intent == "correction":
        return self._handle_correction(user_input, intent_result)
    elif intent_result.intent == "cancel":
        return self._handle_cancellation()
    # ... more intent handlers
```

## Handling Complex User Inputs

### Multi-Information Extraction
Users often provide multiple pieces of information at once:

```python
# User: "I'm John Smith and I need a round trip from SF to NYC next Tuesday"
# System extracts:
entities = {
    "name": "John Smith",
    "trip_type": "round_trip",
    "departure_city": "San Francisco",
    "destination_city": "New York",
    "departure_date": "next Tuesday"
}

# Update all at once
self.booking_info.update_customer_info("first_name", "John")
self.booking_info.update_customer_info("last_name", "Smith")
self.booking_info.update_trip_info("trip_type", "roundtrip")
# ... etc
```

### Correction Handling
```python
def _handle_correction(self, user_input: str, correction_type: str):
    """Handle user corrections at any point"""
    
    # Examples of corrections:
    # "Actually, make that Chicago instead"
    # "Sorry, I meant next Friday"
    # "No, my name is spelled J-O-N"
    
    if correction_type == 'departure':
        old_value = self.booking_info.trip.departure_city
        # Update and acknowledge
        response = f"Got it, changing from {old_value} to {new_value}"
```

## Advanced Conversation Flow Patterns

### 1. Linear Progression (Optimal Path)
```python
# Straightforward, guided booking experience
Alex: "Hi there! I'm Alex from United Airlines. What trip can I help you plan today?"
User: "Hi, I need to book a flight"
Alex: "Perfect! I'd love to help. What's your name?"
User: "Sarah Johnson"
Alex: "Great to meet you, Sarah! Which city are you flying from?"
User: "Chicago"
Alex: "And where would you like to go?"
User: "Boston"
Alex: "Wonderful! Is this a round trip or one-way?"
User: "Round trip"
Alex: "When would you like to depart?"
# Continues with natural progression through all required fields
```

### 2. Information Burst (Efficient Pattern)
```python
# User provides comprehensive information upfront
User: "Hi, I'm Michael Chen and I need a round trip from LA to Seattle, departing next Monday, returning the following Friday"
Alex: "Excellent, Michael! I have round trip from Los Angeles to Seattle, departing Monday and returning Friday. Let me search for the best options for you."
# System intelligently extracts: name, departure, destination, trip_type, departure_date, return_date
# Skips multiple collection states, jumps directly to search
```

### 3. Dynamic Correction Flow
```python
# Sophisticated correction handling with context preservation
Alex: "Flying from San Francisco to Boston on March 15th?"
User: "Yes, but actually I meant March 25th"
Alex: "Got it! I've updated your departure to March 25th. Boston is still correct?"
User: "Actually, make that New York instead of Boston"
Alex: "Perfect! So that's San Francisco to New York on March 25th. When would you like to return?"
# System maintains all correct information while updating changes
```

### 4. Multi-Level Clarification
```python
# Intelligent disambiguation with progressive clarification
User: "I need to fly to Washington next week"
Alex: "I can help with that! Washington has multiple airports - would you prefer Washington DC area (DCA, IAD, or BWI) or Washington State (Seattle area)?"
User: "DC area"
Alex: "Great choice! For DC area, would you prefer Reagan National (DCA) for convenience, or Dulles (IAD) which often has more flight options?"
User: "Whatever's cheaper"
Alex: "Perfect! I'll search all DC area airports and show you the best prices. When would you like to travel?"
```

### 5. Preference-Driven Branching
```python
# Adaptive flow based on user preferences and constraints
User: "I need a flight but I'm on a tight budget"
Alex: "I totally understand! Budget-friendly flights are my specialty. Where are you flying from?"
User: "Denver"
Alex: "And your destination?"
User: "Anywhere on the East Coast for a long weekend"
Alex: "Love it! Let me find you the best deals to East Coast destinations from Denver. Are you flexible with dates? That can save you quite a bit."
# System branches into flexible search mode with price optimization
```

### 6. Error Recovery with Contextual Adaptation
```python
# Sophisticated error handling that maintains conversation flow
User: "I want to go to... um... what's that place... with the big tower?"
Alex: "Hmm, there are several cities with famous towers! Are you thinking of Seattle with the Space Needle, or maybe Paris with the Eiffel Tower? Or perhaps another city?"
User: "Paris!"
Alex: "Ah, Paris is beautiful! However, I specialize in domestic United flights. Would you like me to help you find a great domestic destination, or shall I connect you with our international team for Paris?"
# System gracefully handles ambiguity and service limitations
```

### 7. Parallel Information Processing
```python
# Advanced pattern where multiple information types are processed simultaneously
User: "My company needs three employees to fly from our offices in Austin, Denver, and Miami to our conference in Chicago next month, all returning the same day"
Alex: "That sounds like an important conference! I can definitely help coordinate those flights. Let me break this down:
       - Three travelers from Austin, Denver, and Miami
       - All going to Chicago
       - Same return day
       
       Should I book these as separate reservations or would you prefer a group booking? Also, do you have preferred departure times or airlines?"
# System identifies: multi-origin, single destination, business travel, group coordination needs
```

### Contextual Variations
```python
# First time asking
prompts = {
    "name": ["May I have your name?", "Who am I booking this for?"],
    "departure": ["Which city are you flying from?", "Where will you be departing from?"],
    "destination": ["Where are you headed?", "What's your destination?"]
}

# After correction
correction_prompts = {
    "name": "Could you spell your name for me?",
    "departure": "Which city did you want to fly from?",
    "destination": "Where did you want to go instead?"
}
```

## Advanced Flow Management

### State Persistence
```python
class EnhancedBookingInfo:
    """Maintains conversation state with confidence scores"""
    
    def update_with_confidence(self, field: str, value: Any, confidence: float):
        """Track information with certainty levels"""
        self.data[field] = {
            "value": value,
            "confidence": confidence,
            "timestamp": datetime.now(),
            "source": "user_input"
        }
```

### Conditional Branching
```python
def _handle_flexible_search(self, user_input: str):
    """Handle requests for flexible dates/options"""
    
    if "cheapest" in user_input.lower():
        return self._search_by_price()
    elif "fastest" in user_input.lower():
        return self._search_by_duration()
    elif "flexible" in user_input.lower():
        return self._show_flexible_options()
```

### Recovery Strategies
```python
def _handle_confusion(self):
    """When conversation gets off track"""
    
    attempts = self.context.get('confusion_count', 0)
    
    if attempts == 0:
        return "Let me make sure I understand what you're looking for..."
    elif attempts == 1:
        return "Let's start over. What trip would you like to book?"
    else:
        return "I'll connect you with a human agent who can help better."
```

## User Prompt Strategies

### Progressive Disclosure
Don't overwhelm users with all options at once:
```python
# Initial options (simplified)
"I found 3 flights for you. Would you like to hear them?"

# Detailed presentation (after confirmation)
"Option 1: United flight 523, departing 7:15 AM, nonstop, 
 arriving 3:30 PM, priced at $289"
```

### Implicit Confirmation
Confirm information naturally in conversation:
```python
# Instead of: "You said San Francisco. Is that correct?"
# Use: "Great! Flying from San Francisco. Where to?"
```

### Smart Defaults
```python
def apply_smart_defaults(self):
    """Apply reasonable defaults when appropriate"""
    
    if not self.booking_info.trip.trip_type:
        # Most bookings are round trip
        self.booking_info.update_trip_info(
            "trip_type", "roundtrip", 
            confidence=0.7, source="default"
        )
```

## Advanced Pattern Recognition & Solutions

### Comprehensive Conversation Patterns

#### Pattern: Information Avalanche (Enhanced Processing)
**Problem**: User provides extensive information in a single input
**Advanced Solution**: Intelligent parsing with confirmation and gap identification
```python
class InformationAvalancheHandler:
    """
    Advanced handler for processing complex, multi-faceted user inputs.
    """
    
    def process_information_avalanche(self, user_input: str) -> ProcessingResult:
        # Extract all entities and intents
        extracted_data = self.comprehensive_entity_extractor.extract_all(user_input)
        
        # Organize by booking fields
        organized_info = self._organize_by_booking_fields(extracted_data)
        
        # Identify gaps and conflicts
        gaps = self._identify_missing_information(organized_info)
        conflicts = self._detect_information_conflicts(organized_info)
        
        # Generate intelligent response
        if conflicts:
            return self._handle_conflicts_first(organized_info, conflicts)
        elif gaps:
            return self._confirm_and_fill_gaps(organized_info, gaps)
        else:
            return self._proceed_with_complete_info(organized_info)
    
    def _confirm_and_fill_gaps(self, info: Dict, gaps: List[str]) -> str:
        confirmation = self._generate_confirmation_summary(info)
        gap_request = self._generate_gap_filling_request(gaps)
        
        return f"{confirmation} {gap_request}"
    
    # Example response:
    # "Excellent! I have round trip from Los Angeles to Seattle for Michael Chen, 
    # departing Monday and returning Friday. What time of day do you prefer to fly?"
```

#### Pattern: Intent Cascade (Multi-Intent Processing)
**Problem**: User expresses multiple intents in sequence or simultaneously
**Advanced Solution**: Priority-based intent resolution with context preservation
```python
class IntentCascadeResolver:
    """
    Handles complex scenarios where users express multiple intents.
    """
    
    def resolve_intent_cascade(self, detected_intents: List[Intent], context: Dict) -> ResolutionStrategy:
        # Prioritize intents based on context and user goals
        prioritized_intents = self._prioritize_intents(detected_intents, context)
        
        # Determine resolution strategy
        if self._are_intents_complementary(prioritized_intents):
            return self._handle_complementary_intents(prioritized_intents)
        elif self._are_intents_conflicting(prioritized_intents):
            return self._resolve_conflicting_intents(prioritized_intents)
        else:
            return self._sequence_intent_handling(prioritized_intents)
    
    # Example scenario:
    # User: "I need to change my departure city to Boston and also add a hotel booking"
    # System identifies: [make_correction, request_additional_service]
    # Resolution: Handle correction first, then explain hotel booking limitations
```

#### Pattern: Conversational Loop with Escalating Complexity
**Problem**: Conversation becomes increasingly complex with each iteration
**Advanced Solution**: Adaptive complexity management with strategic simplification
```python
class ComplexityEscalationManager:
    """
    Manages conversations that become increasingly complex over time.
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.complexity_threshold = 0.7

            self._break_into_smaller_steps,
            self._provide_multiple_choice_options,
            self._offer_guided_conversation_mode,
            self._suggest_human_agent_assistance
        ]
    
    def manage_complexity_escalation(self, conversation_history: List, current_complexity: float) -> str:

            # Analyze complexity sources
            complexity_sources = self._analyze_complexity_sources(conversation_history)
            
            # Select appropriate simplification strategy
            strategy = self._select_simplification_strategy(complexity_sources)
            
            return strategy(conversation_history, complexity_sources)
    
    def _break_into_smaller_steps(self, history: List, sources: Dict) -> str:
        return "Let me simplify this. Let's focus on just one thing at a time. First, let's nail down your departure city - where will you be flying from?"
    
    def _provide_multiple_choice_options(self, history: List, sources: Dict) -> str:
        return "I want to make sure I get this right. Would you prefer: A) Start over with a simple booking, B) Continue with your current changes, or C) Speak with a specialist?"
```

#### Pattern: Emotional State Transitions
**Problem**: User emotional state changes during conversation (frustration, excitement, confusion)
**Advanced Solution**: Emotional intelligence with adaptive response strategies
```python
class EmotionalIntelligenceManager:
    """
    Manages conversation flow based on detected user emotional states.
    """
    
    def adapt_to_emotional_transition(self, previous_state: str, current_state: str, context: Dict) -> ResponseAdaptation:
        transition = f"{previous_state}_to_{current_state}"

            "frustrated_to_calm": self._reinforce_positive_momentum,
            "confused_to_confident": self._build_on_understanding,
            "excited_to_overwhelmed": self._manage_information_flow
        }
        
        return adaptation_strategies.get(transition, self._default_emotional_adaptation)(context)
    
    def _handle_emerging_frustration(self, context: Dict) -> ResponseAdaptation:
        return ResponseAdaptation(
            tone="empathetic_and_solution_focused",
            pace="slower_and_more_deliberate",
            content_strategy="acknowledge_frustration_and_offer_alternatives",
            example_response="I hear that this is getting frustrating. Let me see if I can make this easier for you. Would it help if I simplified the options?"
        )
```
