# Quick Fix & Deploy Instructions

## The Issue Was Fixed!
The `sounddevice` module error has been fixed. The backend no longer requires audio libraries since audio is handled on the frontend.

## Deploy via Railway Dashboard

Since Railway CLI is showing multiple services, use the Railway dashboard:

### Option 1: GitHub Deploy (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/united-voice-agent.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. In Railway Dashboard:
   - Click "New Service" 
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select your repository
   - Railway will auto-deploy

### Option 2: Manual Deploy via Dashboard
1. Go to your Railway project: https://railway.com/project/639756e6-f4cb-4f26-bfce-cd7ed231d4b0
2. Click on the service that's failing
3. Go to Settings â†’ Redeploy
4. Or create a new service from GitHub

### Option 3: Use Railway CLI with service name
```bash
# First, identify the correct service in your Railway dashboard
# Then deploy to that specific service:
railway link
railway up
```

## Your Backend URL
Once deployed, Railway will provide a URL like:
- `https://united-voice-agent-production.up.railway.app`
- Or check the Networking tab in your service settings

## Next Steps
1. Get your Railway backend URL from the dashboard
2. Update your Vercel frontend:
   ```bash
   cd voice-frontend
   echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.railway.app" > .env.production
   npx vercel --prod
   ```

## Important Environment Variables in Railway
Make sure these are set:
- `GROQ_API_KEY`
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
- `CORS_ORIGINS=*`
- `PORT=8000`

The sounddevice error is now fixed - your deployment should work!
